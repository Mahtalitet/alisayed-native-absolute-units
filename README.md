# Template designed by [Ali Sayed](https://dribbble.com/shots/1852389-Freebie-Creative-Minimal-Business-Agency-Webpage-Design)
Hello! I am a beginner Front-end Developer. I work anywhere, but I want to find the best employer or team and become a very cool developer! And because of that I started to practice. This is static HTML template which I created with only absolute units.

##Technologies I have used 
I used native technologies and tools like HTML(5) and CSS(3).    
And I didn't add adaptive stylesheets, but I will do it in the future.

##Thanks
I want to thank [Ali Sayed](https://dribbble.com/shots/1852389-Freebie-Creative-Minimal-Business-Agency-Webpage-Design)! He designed this PSD template, which I used in my work.
